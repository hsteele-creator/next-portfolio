      <p>
        Hi, I am Harry Steele and I enjoy combining my personal and technical
        skills to impact the world for the better. I am a frontend software
        developer, specializing in next js and typescript. I am currently a tech
        support agent for a startup company that is bringing a product to the
        market with new AI technology to help prevent drownings in swimming
        pools. While working these jobs I have recently graduated Springboardâ€™s
        software engineering track, where with the help of a senior developer as
        a mentor I was able to build projects, apps, and games to improve my
        software development skills.
